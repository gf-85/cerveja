# Cerveja

This is a project for Coyotiv School of Software Engineering.
It is based on current apps Untappd and Beer with me. 


## Description

Check the [interfaces](https://balsamiq.cloud/srr9y1e/pq808qz/r9402) planned to be build. 

How can you better visualize and play around?
1. Find the button "Full Screen Presentation" and click on it.
2. A dialog named "Full Screen Presentation Settings" should open, then select the checkbox zoom.
3. You should see the first wireframe get larger on the background, click on close and play around.
To exit at any moment the full screen, press esc on your keyboard.

## Steps of the Project Cerveja

### Introduction to Software Engineering
1. Create this repository on Git, clone it and write this README  with LICENSE based on [markdown documentation](https://www.markdownguide.org).
2. Design wireframes on Balsamiq, focus on UI not UX as UX is more complex. Wireframes are used to visualize and focus on possible parent child relationships. It also helps to apply the [lean methodology](https://theleanstartup.com/) based on a possible [minimum viable product or MVP](https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp).
3. Follow best practices about Git:
  1. Pull requests must be done only when there is a significant change on the project.
  2. Commit must always communicate context about a change. Always describe what and why, never how. Commit history must be readable, and follow the [7 rules listed here](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).
  3. Work in a [linear workflow](https://arm.ag/how-to-manage-git-workflow-and-stay-sane-e32405e9dbf0), always rebase before merging changes.
4. Follow best practices about coding standards:
    1. Plan your code, code your plan and only implement what you really need it, do not overcomplicate: "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication".
    2. Apply the concept that the simplest explanation is most likely the right one, based on [Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).
    3. Apply the DRY principle which means don't repeat yourself, based on [KISS, Keep it simple stupid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle#In_software_development) principles.
    4. When naming do not use abbreviations! And apply the following casing conventions:
      1. `kebab-case` for files file-name.js.
      2. `PascalCase` for classes ClassName.
      3. `camelCase`for variables, methods, functions functionName.
      4. `YELLING_CASE` for constants CONSTANT_VALUE.
    5. Follow these [13 points from JavaScript Style Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/google-publishes-a-javascript-style-guide-here-are-some-key-lessons-1810b8ad050b/). 
      1. Use TWO spaces for indentation, instead of tabs.
      2. Every statement must have a semicolon at the end.
      3. Don't use ES6 modules.
      4. Horizontal alignment is discouraged. 
      5. Don't use var, declare variables with `const` or `let` keywords.
      6. Arrow functions are preferred, specially for nested functions.
      7. Use template strings `` `instead of concatenation.
      8. Don't use line continuations for long strings.
      9. `for... of` loop is the preferred type between all three types of 'for loops'.
      10. Don't use eval().
      11. Constants should be named in ALL_UPPERCASE, an exception to the rule is function-scoped when is written in camelCase.
      12. One variable per declaration.
      13. Use `'single'` quotes, not `"double"` quotes.
    6. Add descriptions on the code when needed using `/** description */` [based on JSDoc] (standardjs@com).
    7. Apply [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code style.
